## ML-in-a-box

This repository containers details for the Paperspace ML-in-a-box environments. Paperpsace support both a Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 version each in their separate directories.

Ubuntu 22.04 version is required for H100 machines and recommended for A100s.
Ubuntu 20.04 version is recommended for any other machine selection available on Paperspace.

These distinctions are mainly due to nvidia driver versions needed for different generations of nvidia hardware.

These templates can be used to spin up a Core Machine on Paperspace.

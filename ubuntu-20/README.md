# ML in a Box

This repo houses a script used to turn any Paperspace Ubuntu 20.04 based Linux instance into a fully functional machine learning environment for interactive development. Users are free to modify and run against their own Paperspace instance, be it Linux headless or Linux desktop. The only requirement is a working Nvidia GPU driver pre-installed. A pre-built template exists in the Paperspace eco-system as a Public Template based on a base Ubuntu 20.04 image.

## Who is this for?

We assume a generic advanced data science user who probably wants GPU access, but not any particular specialized subfield of data science such as computer vision or natural language processing. Such users can build upon this base to create their own stack, or we can create other VMs for subfields, similar to what can be done with Gradient containers.

## Software not included

Other software considered but not included.

The potential data science stack is far larger than any one person will use so we don't attempt to cover everything here.

Some generic categories of software not included:

 - Non-data-science software
 - Commercial software
 - Software not licensed to be used on an available VM template
 - Software only used in particular specialized data science subfields (although we assume our users probably want a GPU)

| Category           | Software | Why Not |

| Interpretability   | LIME/SHAP, Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360, InterpretML | |
| Languages          | R, SQL, Julia, C++, JavaScript, Python2, Scala | Python is dominant for data science |
| Monitoring         | Grafana | |
| NLP                | GenSim | |
| Notebooks          | Jupyter, Zeppelin | JupyterLab includes Jupyter notebook |
| Orchestrators      | Kubernetes | Use Gradient cluster|
| Partners           | fast.ai | Could add if we want partner functionality |
| Pipelines          | AirFlow, MLFlow, Intake, Kubeflow | |
| Python libraries   | statsmodels, pymc3, geopandas, Geopy, LIBSVM | Too many to attempt to cover |
| PyTorch extensions | Lightning | |
| R packages         | ggplot, tidyverse | Could add R if customer demand |
| Recommenders       | TFRS, scikit-surprise | |
| Scalable           | Dask, Numba, Spark 1 or 2, Koalas, Hadoop | |
| TensorFlow         | TF 1.15, Recommenders, TensorBoard, TensorRT | Could add TensorFlow 1.x if customer demand. Requires separate tensorflow-gpu for GPU support. |
